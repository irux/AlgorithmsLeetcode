# Leetcode Excercises

This repo is going to contain the Leetcode problems that I solve. I will try to solve it first with the first idea that it cames to my mind. After that , the idea is to search the best posible solution. If I don't find an optimal solution after a couple of days, I will search for the optimal solution, analyses it and then write it here too.

The idea of this repo is to teach me more about algorithms and maybe write them in more than one programming language. In that way , I am going to be able to learn more about other things.
