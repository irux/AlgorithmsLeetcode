# Analysis

The first idea that came to my mind was the optimal. With python, you use the dictionary as a HashTable.

The leetcode feedback said that it is not the optimal solution and it was at the 80%, but I tried to use the other solutions that leetcode mark as better than mine and it didn't improve anything.
